# S07P03 Fix My Workflow

This project is my solution in **C#** to the **Fix My Workflow** practice found in section 07 practice 03 of the UiPath - RPA Developer Foundation course.

### Getting Started

After making a pull request or downloading the project, open the Main.xaml in UiPath Studio.  The robot can be run with the play button in the ribbon and the result can be seen in output panel.

### Practice Requirements

###### **Problem statement : Get Movie Rating From IMDB website**

A workflow received from a colleague isn't working as intended and needs to be fixed using the concepts and features discussed in the course.

Download the workflow for Debugging.

Descriptor_FIx my workflow.zip
2.3 MB
The provided workflow needs to be fixed to perform the following tasks:

Search for the movie "The Ice Age" on the IMDb website.
Retrieve the IMDb rating of the movie.
Display the IMDb rating through a messagebox.

**Notes:** The practice source file is located in
 Data\Sample Data\Descriptor_FIxMyWorkflow.zip.
 Since the source Fix My Workflow content was in VB.Net, it cannot be directly
 used in this C# project.  As such this is a mapping of the instructions to
 obtain the same result.

 Also, I chose to refactor the process so it will lookup multiple titles.

### Details

**Course:** UiPath - RPA Developer Foundation

**Section:** 07 Project Organization

**Practice:** 03 Fix My Workflow

**Project Format:** Windows, C#

### Architecture Requirements

A standard UiPath, Studio to Orchestrator cloud setup is the base of operation.  It is easy to setup and free.
1. An Orchestrator connection - Visit https://cloud.uipath.com/ and authenticate or sign up.
2. [UiPath Studio](https://www.uipath.com/product/studio) is used to run the robot.  Note that Studio Web can be used directly in Orchestrator but I recommend installing the Studio IDE application.

### Git Notes

Clone the project to develop or change it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ShonHarsh/RPADev-S07P03-FixMyWorkflow
```
